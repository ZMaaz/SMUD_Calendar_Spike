# SMUD_Calendar_Spike
The purpose of this library is to automate the need for end users to manually
input calendars for "n" number of years for multiple shifts such as: 9F11, 9F21, 9M11 et cetera.

This product leverages the ClickSoftware FSE APIs

Three .py files are required to run this script that includes URL, username, and password that is not provided in the files. 

This automation surpasses the limitations of the product's importing functionality of only uploaded 6 month calendars. The max capacity we attempted was a full three years.
